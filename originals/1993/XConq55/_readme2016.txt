These are tools and library code from 1993 to port the game 
XConq https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xconq
to MSDOS where no X11 was available (at least to me). It could be
played on multiple machines as the original via exchanging
files on a network share.

As a remark: I never really played the game, but porting it
was real fun.
