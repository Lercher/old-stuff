begin{notes}

Of course, this will not be exactly like empire - for one thing, xconq maps
are in hexes and not in squares!  However, we can reproduce the characteristics
of the playing pieces fairly well.

The chief defects are that combat is always mutual, rather than
one-side-at-a-time hits, and that cities must have capacity for armies.
In the latter case, this period fixes an annoying defect of the original
empire game!  Also, some of the messages are a little weird.

There is also an imbalance in that ships defeating armies don't run
aground, so they are more useful than in the original.
