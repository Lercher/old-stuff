begin{notes}
This is a somewhat expanded version of the navy in the standard period.
Each side commands a large fleet, and the sole objective is to wipe out
the enemy's fleet.  There are different kinds of planes and ships, but
nothing else.

Speeds of ships are uniform, so that formations work better (don't want
the carriers outstripping their escorts).

You do *not* get complete control over the aircraft!  Those undisciplined
pilots just do what they feel like doing, and only take about half their
orders.
