begin{notes}
This period is the default built-in set of period parameters.  It
represents units of about 1945, from infantry to atomic bombs.  This is
the most familiar, which makes it easier to play, but also more controversial,
since historians have many conflicting theories about which kinds of
units were most effective.

Infantry.  The infantry division is the slowest of units, but it can go almost
anywhere.  It is also quick to produce.  Infantry is the staple of
campaigns - a little boring perhaps, but essential to success.

Guerilla.  These units are hard to see and are the only land unit that
can move through swamp.

Armor.  The armor division is highly mobile and hits hard.
Unfortunately, it is limited to operating in open terrain - plains and
desert.  It also takes longer to produce.  Armor can last twice as
long in the desert as infantry.  Both armor and infantry can assault
and capture cities; they are the only units that can do so.

CAP.  Combat Air Patrol doesn't need to land to refuel, just get close
to a base or city.  They are the best at air to air combat.

Fighter/Bomber.  These units are best at pinbombing guerillas, infantry
and armor.  They do moderately well in air to air combat.

SR-72.  The SR-71 Blackbird has awesome visual range with OK accuracy
(it can miss units that are far away.  Its speed, range, and defense
make it the perfect spyplane.

Combat Helicopter.  These are the tank destroyers.  They are good for
desert warfare against tanks.

Cargo Helicopter.  These massive aircraft can carry infantry, or armor,
 but their limited range restricts them to short hops across the pond.
They also suck eggs in combat.

Bomber groups.  Bombers are very powerful, since they can seriously
damage or even flatten cities.  The loss rate in such activities is
high, so they're not a shortcut to victory!  They can take more damage
than fighter/bombers.  They can also carry tacnukes or infantry

PT boats.  These patrol boats are good for patrolling a coast, but not
much else.  You really need a real boat to do any damage to incoming
vessels.

Destroyers.  Destroyers are fast small ships for both exploration and
anti-submarine activities.

Submarines.  The favorite food of submarines is of course merchant shipping
and troopships, and they can sink troop transports with one blow.
Subs are also invisible, but they are vulnerable to destroyers and aircraft.

Troop transports.  This is how ground units get across the sea.  They can
defend themselves against ships and aircraft, but are basically vulnerable.
They're not very fast either.

Aircraft carriers.  Compensates for the fighter's limited range by
providing a portable airport.  Carriers themselves are sitting ducks,
particularly with respect to aircraft.  Fighter patrols are mandatory.
Large radar range gives them some advanced warning.

Battleships.  The aptly named "Dread Naught" has little to fear from
other units of this period.  Subs may sink them with enough effort,
and a group of bombers and fighters are also deadly, but with eight
hit points to start, a battleship can usually survive long enough to
escape.  Battleships are very effective against cities and armies, at
least the ones on the coast.  Battleships can also carry tacnukes.

TAC.  This is a Tactical Nuclear Warhead.  These cause massive damage
crippling cities for a range of 2 from the center and destroying
almost everything but aircraft and the bigger ships.

Atomic bombs.  The Final Solution; but they are not easy to use.  A
bomb takes a long time to produce, moves very slowly by itself, and is
easily destroyed by other units.  The plus side is massive destruction
for any unit of any size!  Bombs are imagined to be transported by a
team of scientists, and can go on any sort of terrain without running
out of supplies.  They can also be carried by bombers for quick
gratification, but look out.  They blast in a radius of 3.

Bases.  To simplify matters, this can serve as a camp, airbase, and
port.  Bases cannot build normal units, but can build minefields.
They can repair damage slowly and make fuel and ammo.  A string of
bases will serve as a supply line through the desert or mountains.
Bases can, with some work be turned into radar stations.

Radar.  These units see (with some inaccuracy) for 10 hexes.  They are
great for keeping an eye on those rear areas and strategically
important battlefields.  They don't produce or hold much fuel, but can
be converted back to bases if the need arises.

Towns.  Towns are the staple of territory.  They can build, repair, produce
fuel and ammo, and serve as a safe haven for quite a few units.

Cities.  Cities are very large, powerful, and well defended.  They are
basically capital cities, or something in a comparable range.  (New York
and San Francisco are cities, Salt Lake City and San Antonio are towns.)
A city is worth five towns, territory-wise.


Current thinking about optimal strategy for this period differs.  In general,
blitzkrieg works, and can win the game in a hurry.  The problem is to
muster enough force before striking.  One full troop transport is not
enough; the invasion will melt away like ice cream on a hot sidewalk, unless
reinforcements (either air or land) show up quickly.  Air cover is very
important.  While building up an invasion force, airborne assaults using
bombers and infantry can provide useful diversions, although it can be
wasteful of bombers.  Human vs human games on the default map generally
last about 100 turns, usually not enough time or units to build atomic
bombs or battleships, and not a big enough map to really need carriers
(although bases for staging are quite useful.)

  This period is best on large maps.  You get a chance to play with
the more expensive toys.  I have only been able to play against robots
(none of the humans around here want to expend the effort required to
master this period) and they are usually pretty dumb.

  A tacnuke before invading a nation can't hurt, just be careful to
TAKE that country.  The cities will be crippled (use infantry to
repair them) and robots don't know how to repair.  Two tacnukes will
almost level a country, just send in bombers to finish the job.  Use
tacnukes to clobber large formations of ground units, or large groups
of ships.  Owning an SR-71 can make the difference between effective
use of nukes or major wastage.  SR-71s are immune to the blast (of
TACS, not real nukes), so send them in to find the best place to
level.  Battleships are the cheapest way to take out guerillas.  The
robots seem to love guerillas, they're annoying in the extreme.
