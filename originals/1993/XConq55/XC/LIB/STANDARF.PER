begin{notes}
This period is the default built-in set of period parameters.  It
represents units of about 1945, from infantry to atomic bombs.  This is
the most familiar, which makes it easier to play, but also more controversial,
since historians have many conflicting theories about which kinds of
units were most effective.

Infantry.  The infantry division is the slowest of units, but it can go almost
anywhere.  It is also quick to produce.  Infantry is the staple of
campaigns - a little boring perhaps, but essential to success.

Armor.  The armor division is highly mobile and hits hard.  Unfortunately,
it is limited to operating in open terrain - plains and desert.  It also
takes longer to produce.  Armor can last twice as long in the 
desert as infantry.  Both armor and infantry can
assault and capture cities; they are the only units that can do so.

Fighters.  A fighter is a squadron or wing of high-speed armed aircraft.
Their fuel supply can be gotten only at units, towns, and bases, so they
must continually be taking off and landing.  Fighters are not too effective
against ground units or ships, but they eat bombers for lunch.  Fighters
are very good for reconnaisance - important in a game where you can't always
see the enemy moving!

Bomber groups.  Bombers are very powerful, since they can seriously damage
or even flatten cities.  The loss rate in such activities is high, so they're
not a shortcut to victory!

Destroyers.  Destroyers are fast small ships for both exploration and
anti-submarine activities.

Submarines.  The favorite food of submarines is of course merchant shipping
and troopships, and they can sink troop transports with one blow.
Subs are also invisible, but they are vulnerable to destroyers and aircraft.

Troop transports.  This is how ground units get across the sea.  They can
defend themselves against ships and aircraft, but are basically vulnerable.
They're not very fast either.

Aircraft carriers.  Compensates for the fighter's limited range by providing
a portable airport.  Carriers themselves are sitting ducks, particularly
with respect to aircraft.  Fighter patrols are mandatory.

Battleships.  The aptly named "Dread Naught" has little to fear from other
units of this period.  Subs may sink them with enough effort, and a group
of bombers and fighters are also deadly, but with eight hit points to start,
a battleship can usually survive long enough to escape.  Battleships are very
effective against cities and armies, at least the ones on the coast.

Atomic bombs.  The Final Solution; but they are not easy to use.  A bomb
takes a long time to produce, moves very slowly by itself, and is easily
destroyed by other units.  The plus side is instant destruction for any unit
of any size!  Bombs are imagined to be transported by a team of scientists,
and can go on any sort of terrain without running out of supplies.

Bases.  To simplify matters, this can serve as a camp, airbase, and port.
Bases cannot build units, although they can repair some damage.

Towns.  Towns are the staple of territory.  They can build, repair, produce
fuel and ammo, and serve as a safe haven for quite a few units.

Cities.  Cities are very large, powerful, and well defended.  They are
basically capital cities, or something in a comparable range.  (New York
and San Francisco are cities, Salt Lake City and San Antonio are towns.)
A city is worth five towns, territory-wise.

Current thinking about optimal strategy for this period differs.  In general,
blitzkrieg works, and can win the game in a hurry.  The problem is to
muster enough force before striking.  One full troop transport is not
enough; the invasion will melt away like ice cream on a hot sidewalk, unless
reinforcements (either air or land) show up quickly.  Air cover is very
important.  While building up an invasion force, airborne assaults using
bombers and infantry can provide useful diversions, although it can be
wasteful of bombers.  Human vs human games on the default map generally
last about 100 turns, usually not enough time or units to build atomic
bombs or battleships, and not a big enough map to really need carriers
(although bases for staging are quite useful.)
